## Key Findings

### Performance by Game

**Alien (High-reward game):**
- DQN + Dueling Networks showed strong performance in shorter tests
- DQN + Priority Replay demonstrated excellent learning with longer training
- Distributed RL showed promise with consistent performance
- All algorithms achieved positive rewards (80-380 range)

**Ice Hockey (Challenging game):**
- All algorithms struggle with negative rewards (-2 to -7 range)
- DQN + Priority Replay performed best (least negative rewards)
- Game appears more difficult for RL agents to master
- Longer episodes (1500 steps) due to game mechanics

### Algorithm Performance Analysis

1. **DQN + Priority Replay**: 
   - Best overall performer across both games
   - Shows good sample efficiency and learning stability
   - Consistent improvement with more episodes

2. **DQN + Dueling Networks**:
   - Strong performance in Alien game
   - Separating value and advantage streams helps in some scenarios
   - Good training speed

3. **Distributed RL + Priority**:
   - Shows promise in 20-episode experiment  
   - Leverages multiple workers for faster data collection
   - More complex setup but potentially higher performance ceiling

4. **Basic DQN**:
   - Solid baseline performance
   - Fastest training time
   - Good starting point for comparison
